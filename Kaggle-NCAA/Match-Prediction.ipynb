It is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game.\n",
    "- **StrongSeed** - this indicates the expected stronger-seeded team that plays in this game. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the WNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column. In the first record of this file (slot R1W1), we see that seed W01 is the \"StrongSeed\". Whereas for games from Round 2 or later, rather than a team seed, we will see a \"slot\" referenced in this column. So in the 33rd record of this file (slot R2W1), it tells us that the winners of slots R1W1 and R1W8 will face each other in Round 2. Of course, in the last few games of the tournament - the national semifinals and finals - it's not really meaningful to talk about a \"strong seed\" or \"weak seed\", since you would have #1 seeds favored to face each other, but those games are nevertheless represented in the same format for the sake of consistency.\n",
    "- **WeakSeed** - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game, assuming all favored teams have won so far. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the WNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas "
